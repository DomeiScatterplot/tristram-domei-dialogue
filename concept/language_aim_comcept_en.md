# 🎮 **Game Concept: "Command"**

---

## ■ Overview

The player reads **instruction texts displayed on screen** and responds by operating switches and levers correctly.
Through buttons, toggles, and sliders, the player **demonstrates comprehension through action**.
The game is based on three stages of training: *Read – React – Reproduce.*

---

## ■ Core Concept

* A non-conversational language game focused on **reading and reactive understanding**.
* Learn language not through “understanding,” but through **action**.
* Centered on imperative and formal written expressions.
* The creator defines this project as **“aim training for language.”**

---

## ■ Game Rules

* Instruction lines appear from top to bottom.
* Completing each task activates the next one.
* No penalty for mistakes — emphasis on repetition and mastery.

---

## ■ Control Panel (UI Layout)

* Buttons (Red / Blue / Green / White)
* Toggle Switches (ON / OFF)
* Levers (Up / Down / Forward / Backward)
* Sliders (Left / Right)
* Indicators (ON / OFF)

> The arrangement changes randomly each round.

## ■ Example Commands

|  Difficulty  | Japanese                | Chinese             | Russian                                                    |
| :----------: | :---------------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Beginner   | 赤いボタンを押せ。               | 按红色按钮。              | Нажми красную кнопку.                                      |
|   Beginner   | 緑のスイッチを入れろ。             | 打开绿色开关。             | Включи зелёный переключатель.                              |
| Intermediate | レバーを右へ倒せ。               | 把杆子往右推。             | Отведи рычаг вправо.                                       |
| Intermediate | 二つ目のボタンを先に押せ。           | 先按第二个按钮。            | Сначала нажми вторую кнопку.                               |
|   Advanced   | インジケータが光ったらスイッチを切れ。     | 灯亮后关闭开关。            | Когда загорится лампа, выключи переключатель.              |
|   Advanced   | 他の操作をせず、赤いスライダーを左端まで戻せ。 | 不要做其他操作，把红色滑块推到最左边。 | Не выполняй других действий, верни красный ползунок влево. |
|   Advanced   | レバーを下げた後、青のボタンを三回押せ。    | 拉下杆子后按三次蓝色按钮。       | Опусти рычаг, затем нажми синюю кнопку трижды.             |
|   Advanced   | ランプが消えていれば、白いスイッチを入れろ。  | 如果灯灭了，就打开白色开关。      | Если лампа погасла, включи белый переключатель.            |

🔹 **Design Note:**
Each language increases in complexity by combining direct action, conditional phrases, and sequential logic.
Advanced examples include time and conditional structures like “if/then” and “after.”
Russian follows the tone of real military or technical instructions.
There is **no time limit** for any stage.

---

## ■ Learning System

* Instruction texts are structured by difficulty (Beginner → Advanced).
* Available languages: Japanese, Chinese, Russian (extensible).
* Commands are generated from **templates with variables**.
* Hint language can be set independently from the command language.
* When a user hovers over a keyword or UI element, **contextual hints** are displayed for mutual reference.

---

## ■ Development Elements

* Engine: Unity or Godot
* Command logic and conditions managed with JSON
* Progression based on **state snapshots**

---

## ■ Target Audience

* Learners who wish to **practice comprehension through action**
* Developers learning UI-related terminology
* Players who prefer **text-based interaction**

---

## ■ Background and Expansion

The concept originates from **resource management games**,
where buttons and switches are part of the user’s input model.

However, in other genres—such as **FPS games**—the most striking command the creator ever heard was
“**Save the hostage.**”
It transcends small talk or mechanical instructions and becomes a **language of decisive action**.

Thus, the creator envisions expanding this **“read-to-act”** gameplay structure
across multiple genres and interactive systems.

Even in FPS titles where **voice communication** is crucial,
short phrases like “Thanks,” “Copy,” or equivalents in other languages
enhance cooperative experiences.

Words like Russian **“Давай (Davaï),” “Спасибо (Spasibo),”** or **“Пожалуйста (Pozhaluysta)”**
represent the kind of **compact, functional vocabulary** this game encourages.

In essence, the project seeks to merge **command, response, and cooperation**
as linguistic behaviors within diverse game genres.
